# Earthquake Visualisation.
--------------
Located in the Pacific Ring Of Fire, Japan is the first on the list as nation with the greatest number of earthquakes- [source: world atlas website](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-world-s-10-most-earthquake-prone-countries.html).  
The purpose of this repository is to have an overview of the last 7 days of earthquakes at any time that the data is refreshed with a focus on earthquakes felt in Japan.  
In Part 1 of this repository We will illustrate a worldmap with earthquaeks over the last 7 Days - where the marker of each reflects the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by colour. 
Part 2 of this repository will include a map layer illustrating the techtonic plates in order to llustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. 

--------------
The repository visualises [] data set using javascript leaflet library.   
Using the index.html files attached we are able to get an understanding of Earthquake measurements while reflecting magnitude and depth values.

### Images
- View images in directory to see final visualisation

## Analysis Summary
### Leaflet Part 1
- From directory Leaflet-Part-1 load index.html
- Associated logic.js shows earthquake markers with the marker size scaled to the magnitude level while marker color is varying to depth level.  

    
### Leaflet Part 2
- from directory Leaflet-Part-2 load index.html
- Associated logic.js includes "Topographic Map" as additional map view.  
    There is now a Tectonic Plates layter which will show
